This is a project focused on how math, technology, and art can intersect.

It uses Pygame, so a Python interpreter that can support Pygame should be used- Replit, for example, has a specific Pygame option when creating a project.

I also created many images to be used in the game (8 of them), so the program may not run if they are removed.


The display screen dimensions can be specified at the top of the screen_text module. 800:450 is a pretty good ratio.

To play, move your mouse around the screen and click on objects. Remember, black holes are pretty to look at, but once you go to far into it, there's no coming out!

To restart the game, click the "X" in the top right corner, and run it again.
